# prrong

A reprise of [prong][prong-link], my Java clone of PONG.

## About _prrong_
=================
_prong_ was a Grade 12 project for my Computer Science class. We were tasked to
use all of the knowledge we gained from the course (GUI, OOP, documentation,
etc.) to build our own games. PONG seemed simple enough, but clearly I didn't
know what I was doing.

After further code review, it was too tedious for me to actually salvage the
code. Rewriting it would be my best option.

My goal for _prrong_ is to write it using a model-view-controller architecture.

## How To Run
=============
Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed on your system.
Download all of the files and save them into one directory.

On the command line, make sure you're in the directory of the files. Execute `make
all` to compile all of the Java files. After compilation, execute `make run` to
run the Client file.
